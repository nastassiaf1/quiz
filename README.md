# Quiz Game

This is a simple quiz game built with React and TypeScript. It utilizes `react-hook-form` for form management and leverages React's `useTransition` for smooth transitions between questions. The game also includes a countdown timer for each question, using `setInterval` and `useRef` to manage time constraints.
